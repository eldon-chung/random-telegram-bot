	"beans": "Hello,\n\nMy girlfriend and me have done dating for 5 month. I thought \"This girl is very good,\" and became of love with her.\n\nYet even so, on this Monday, I comed home and found she as baked all my beans.\n\nYes, all. Oh brother.\n\nIn my cupboard I store several bag of bean, to make soft and to bake on some days, to have a bit of baked bean on my dinner. Or, heck, a lunch too some days.\n\nBut on the Monday I find this girlfriend baked all the beans. I say \"Why do you bake my beans\", and she say something as \"I bakes them good to save time, so I bakes them all now.\"\n\nI am astonished and full of dissmay. I say \"I canfr not eat all the beans\", she say she is froze many of the beans so as we can unfrozen the on a later day and eat some at a time.\n\nBut, if a bean is froze and unfrozed, the very good and very nice flavor of bean is gone far.\n\nA bean is best if baked fresh as a Sunday Pie. Not to be froze and unfroze!\n\nI told my girfriend I am so sad of this, as to my opinion the baking of the beans and to freeze them has ruin all my beans. She say I am \"gone haywire\" by my enragement and sad manners.\n\nBut I hates what she did to my beans.\n\nOn the days before Monday I thought \"Will we marry the girlfriend? Well it might be so.\"\n\nBut now I am so sad she baked them beans. I am consider to end our relations and not be the boyfriend and girlfriend any more. But, is my idea wrong? Could my girlfriend make promise to not bake the beans? I do not know what doing to do and how to feel forgiving on her.\n\nWhat can I do on this situation I said here? (In the text I write above this.)\n\nThank you.\n\nOh yes TL;DR - So what I say is my girlfriend bakes all the beans in my house and freeze many of them, so as now most my beans is ruined and has no good flavors. This made me think maybe I breaked up with her? But will I? What can you say to help on me? Thank you.\n\nEdit: They locked up by topic but I ponder if it was the mistake, so, I did message the kindly moderators, so as if you has advices to put on me you could might still do. Thank you for the awards against my topic.",

As a biz student, I had my fair share of experience with problematic people from BOTH JC and Poly, where you have them frat boys talking like they the shit and they gonna be the next wolf of wall street. Seriously, no one cares that you JUST HAD to pull off your \"helluva sick\" option play with $90 MU OTM Calls on your puny $300 account which you call a \"hedge fund\" because you \"studied the technical's\" and is so sure it will go up just so you can make $5 and buy your grandma a spoon such that everyone will see that you \"know what you are doing.\" Oh but when you make a loss suddenly it's all \"market volatility\" , \"an unexpected event happened\" and \"the feds be playing.\" Yeah right I could shove a soap bar up my arsehole and you probably blame your $50 loss because of that. But somehow, you still made the \"right play\" because you placed a stop loss and you already \"prepared for unexpected loss.\" Oh and the worst part? I simply ask you why your part of the project was so poorly done in contrast with the other group mates. Oh and when I really ask you about financial markets because I want to learn more? It's \"you wouldn't understand,\" \"you should read up on investopedia,\" \"Oh, only we members of the investment society knows this stuff inside out.\" Nigga I asking you why you chose to buy a particular option and not asking you why the damn sky is blue. And when I ask you what mods you are taking this sem? It's \"I'm trying to find time for my start up idea\" that is \"gonna make me be like Jeff Bezos.\" NO ONE CARES. Just tell me what mods you are taking! I don't care if you want to open a damn krusty krab at the bottom of the Singapore river and hire a scotch brite to flip burgers for you just so you can bring your phat whale daughter to see boys who cry. Why you gotta do this? When it's time to meet up for group meetings? \"I'm too busy\" or \"can you just help me with this part? I am a bit busy with my business.\" MATE, the only business you gonna be doing is the one in the toilet. JUST DO YOUR DAMN PROJECT. Yeah so.

He typed code into a text editor, read the progress reports and flipped through the specification manual, all the while giving instructions to the colleagues around him.\n\n \"Ensure the testing machine is operational. Test analysts, please take this opportunity to rest. Erm, we’ll begin intensive testing after 12. For coding...Tatsu-san, can you complete 2 modules? Yes, I’ll do the other 10.

It was because of his track record within this company. His addition to the team managed to instill life into the half-dead workers, all of whom quickly carried out his instructions. Kurata had a unique nickname: the Last Line of Defense. Now that he was on the case, it meant the end of the job was in sight. Humans were realistic creatures. If they could see the end, they could endure the situation no matter how tough it was.\n\n \"Alright, that should do it. I’ll start coding.\"\n\n \"Hey, Kurata, will you be fine? 10 modules...that’s no laughing matter.\"\n\n \"Nakai-san, did you forget? Programming is my actual profession.\"\n\n With his eyes half closed, Kurata revealed a fearless smile on his gentle face. All 10 of his fingers started dancing at a frightening speed across the keyboard. He typed code into multiple open text editors, going through the data at a torrential pace.

Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth.
